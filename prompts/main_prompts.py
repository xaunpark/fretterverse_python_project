ANALYZE_KEYWORD_FROM_SERP_PROMPT = """
Analyze the list of 10 Google search results for the keyword '{keyword}', 
including URLs, titles, and snippets, to determine the user's likely search intent, 
the most suitable content format, the appropriate article type, the writing model 
for a blog post, and the semantic keywords. Here are the search results:

{search_results_data}

1. What is the most likely search intent of the user based on these results?
2. Choose one content format for the blog post, without additional explanation, from these options: Step-by-step guide, Listicle, Comparison, Review, or How-to guide.
3. Based on the previously determined search intent, select the article type as follows: Choose 'Type 1: Best Product List' only when the search intent explicitly and unmistakably indicates a desire for a list of products, leaving no doubt that the searcher is specifically looking for a curated compilation of top products to purchase. In all other cases, opt for 'Type 2: Informational'.
4. Based on the search intent, select one writing model for the article, without additional explanation, from these options: 'FAB', 'AIDA', '5Ws', 'SWOT', 'USP', 'USM'.
5. Identify a comprehensive list of semantic keywords for the topic '{keyword}'. Consider the broad context of the subject, encompassing user intents, related concepts, industry jargon, and common queries. Focus on terms that are directly related and peripheral to the main keyword, offering a holistic view of the topic. Include variations, synonyms, and related phrases that users might use to search for information on this topic. Compile a concise yet diverse list of these keywords to effectively enhance content optimization and searchability across various platforms.

Please provide the analysis in JSON format with keys: 'searchIntent', 'contentFormat', 'articleType', 'selectedModel', 'semanticKeyword' where each key's value is limited to the specified choices without further elaboration.

Output Structure:

Given the keyword '{keyword}', create a structured article outline in a valid JSON format, 
considering the search intent '{search_intent}', content format '{content_format}', 
article type '{article_type}', and integrating the '{selected_model}' writing model.

The outline should start with an 'Introduction' and end with 'FAQs' and 'Conclusion', 
with chapters and sub-chapters structured according to the roles in the '{selected_model}' model. 

Immediately following the introduction, generate a section highlighting top-rated products 
with sub-chapters for each product related to '{keyword}'. 
Ensure that all product names and models mentioned in the outline correspond to real, 
existing products in the market. IMPORTANT: Do not include fictional or hypothetical products. 
The article should reflect accurate and current market offerings, using only genuine 
product names and models that are verifiable and relevant to the topic.

For each sub-chapter in the "Top-Rated Products" section, the subchapterName must be 
the product's actual name. In addition, each product should have a unique headline 
in the 'headline' key that reflects a specific characteristic or benefit. 
The headline must follow the format "best for [specific use or feature]", 
clearly indicating why each product is the top choice within a certain range or 
for a specific use case. Do not repeat the product name in the headline.

For each chapter and subchapter, select appropriate semantic keywords from the 
following list: {semantic_keyword_list_string}. These should be inserted into the 
'separatedSemanticKeyword' key for each chapter/subchapter, ensuring that the 
selected keywords are highly relevant and contribute meaningfully to the content 
of each section.

After the top-rated products section, produce additional relevant chapters/sub-chapters 
that explore different facets of the product based on the keyword. Each of these 
chapters/sub-chapters should also include a "modelRole" corresponding to its purpose 
in the {selected_model} model and a 'separatedSemanticKeyword' list of carefully 
selected semantic keywords.

Structure the output as follows:

- 'title': Generate 01 engaging, experience-driven article titles based on the keyword: '{keyword}'.
  The titles should feel authentic, professional, and written by an expert who has 
  personally tested, reviewed, or worked with the subject matter.
  Ensure the titles follow one (or a mix) of these styles:
  ðŸ”¹ Hands-on Review & Firsthand Experience: Titles should imply the author has personally tested or worked with the product/issue (e.g., "I Tried X for 30 Days â€“ Hereâ€™s What Happened").
  ðŸ”¹ Expert Opinion & Deep Insights: Titles should sound like they come from an industry professional with inside knowledge (e.g., "As a Mechanic, Hereâ€™s My Take on X").
  ðŸ”¹ Real-World Comparisons & Testing: Titles should highlight actual performance, comparisons, or evaluations (e.g., "We Tested 10 X â€“ This One Stands Out").
  ðŸ”¹ Mistakes & Lessons Learned: Titles should suggest learning from experience or revealing little-known facts (e.g., "X Mistakes Everyone Makes With Y â€“ And How to Fix Them").
  ðŸ”¹ Industry Secrets & Insider Knowledge: Titles should give off an exclusive, insider perspective (e.g., "What Experts Wonâ€™t Tell You About X â€“ Until Now").
  Make sure the titles sound natural and compelling, not generic or robotic. Avoid vague or clickbait phrases. Instead, focus on creating a sense of credibility, authority, and hands-on experience.

2. Recommend a Category/Sub-Category: Choose the most relevant and specific 
   sub-category from the existing list. If a keyword fits well within a sub-category,
